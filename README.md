# AI-k-means
k-means, an unsupervised machine learning and clustering algorithm.

#### Usage
```make```, then ```./cancer``` or ```./iris```


#### Means implemented:
1. Arithmetic
2. Geometric
3. Harmonic

#### Distance formulas implemented are
1. Euclidean
2. Manhattan (often really bad!)

**Normalization** is also provided and defaulted to 0.5 to 1.5 (see `NORM_MIN` and `NORM_MAX` in `globals.h`) so that geometric mean calculations will produce correct results.  

Instructions are yet to come. Command line arguments are not yet implemented for Distance and Mean selection.  A bash files will be added/modified to allow this functionality in the future.
